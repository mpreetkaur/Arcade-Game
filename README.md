## Arcade-Game
This game is much similar to the _frogger-game_  in which frog needs to cross the road without striking with the vehicles. Similarly,
in this game player needs to cross the path without colliding with any of the _enemy bugs_. 

## Getting Started
When game loads up, a player will display with some _enemy bugs_ moving horizontally from left to right. You can use arrow keys to move the player and save him from the enemies.
